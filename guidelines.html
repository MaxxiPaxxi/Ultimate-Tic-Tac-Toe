    <h1>Welcome to the Ultimate Tic Tac Toe</h1>
    <p id='title'>A strategic boardgame for 2 players</p>
    <br>
    <h2>Here are the rules</h2>
    <p>This game is intended for 2 players. The goal of this game is just like tic-tac-toe class,
        you win by getting 3 in a row. Each smaller 3x3 grids are called the local boards and the larger 3x3 grid is the global board.
        When player X plays in a spot, the local board in which player Y will be able to play will be deciding using the position of player X's tic relative to the local board.
        For example,
        The game starts with X playing wherever they want in any of the 81 empty spots. This move "sends" their opponent to its relative location. For example, if X played in the top right square of their local board, then O needs to play next in the local board at the top right of the global board. O can then play in any one of the nine available spots in that local board, each move sending X to a different local board.
        When a player wins a local board, it is marked by him and is made unavailable, thus sending players anywhere to the global board when played upon.
        And thus players play until one of them wins 3 local boards in a row.
